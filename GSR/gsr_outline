My general thoughts:

- model the genotypic impact on measurable traits
  - meaning create a model to predict traits based on a model including genotype and kinship
  


Overall drive of the project will be to look for modules of genes (gene clusters) that have undergone
selection for certain traits.

GWAS used to discover:

1. Genes underlying quantitative traits
2. Genes underlying coexpression of genes (gene modules eigen values)
3. SNPs associated with gene expression values


1. Gene modules using WGCNA
2. use the eigenvalues from the modules (the PC1) as the trait and model using the genotype values and kinship as fixed effect
  2.a. do I need to add covariates? What are the covariates in this case?
3. use the FPKM of the each of the genes within a module to do GWAS on each of those genes
4. Collect the top SNPs from all of the gwas studies and perform a Qx to look for regions of the genome that have diverged (been under selection)

So introduction topics will be:
  - The need to understand how to predict traits
  - simple ways this has been implimented
  - Issues in GWAS - relateness, and how to deal with it
  - simplifying genetic complexity via creating modules
  - GWAS background
  - potential uses for this type of approach

Several calls for re-thinking the statistical approaches for calculating 

OR dealing with the small-effect/latent genes that also have a cumulative major impact on traits, but
go unmeasured because of statistical power/their small effects
  
Modeling can be useful for seeing outliers, looking for adaptation within measured groups, seeing adaptation 
outside of groups.
  
What results in traits
  - genomic quality (dominance, heritability, effect size)
  - selection (adaptation to environment)
  - drift
  - population structure
  
Goals and Objectives
  - Model
  - Incorporate

Current benefits of GWAS
GWA studies are used to find association/correlation between a trait and a genomic marker, often a signle
nucleotide polymorphism, and are used in almost all fields of biological research. However, each organism
and population, and research goal, introduces new assumptions and limitations to a GWA study.
Genome wide association (GWA) studies investigating association between genes and traits of interest
have led to the discovery and characterization of many causal genes in maize [citations].
Something about the limitations and assumptions of 


=========
Q_x is the way it will be

So, I'm finishing the GWAS on the traits

Then doing GWAS on the modules, using FPKM as the traits
  - here, eigengenes
  
Then, doing GWAS on the genes within each module, and looking for small cis effects (still using FPKM as the trait?)

This will produce a set of SNPs, some that are invluential to the module as a whole (from the eigengene GWAS) and 
others that are more important to an individual gene within the module (SNPs from individual gene GWAS).

From this set of SNPs, perform a Qx analysis, which will look for the ditribution of the traits among populations
that is not explained by relatedness. A positive hit in Qx indicates that that SNP has variation that is different 
(probably a higher degree of variance) than the expected MVN distribution.

Where this is tricky is... what does this mean? That the eigengene has a SNP that has been under selection, so all the genes
in the module are underselection?

Current Project outline

Major questions:
- quantitative traits
  - genetic architecture underlying those traits
  - genetic variation and the selection for that variation
- local adaptation, and how plants adapt to stressful environments
- expression as a quantitative trait
  - gene expression as an understudied trait
- linking gene expression to traits of interest
- expanding this to selection in the context of stress - is someone in Jeff's lab already doing this?

Introduction

=================
Relevance and justification - why project relevant to mission of Dept Plant Sciences

- most of the traits that humans find valuable in plants, and many of the traits that matter for the plant, are quantitative traits
  - examples: crop yield, leaf shape
- quantitative traits remain difficult to parse out, despite the increase of genomic data
  - examples: 
  
determining both the underlying genetic architecture of the quantitative traits, and in the selective forces that shape those traits remains
 challenging.

In the broader scheme of plants, exstablishing methods to robustly measure the genetic architecture behind quantitative traits would be beneficial 
to agriculture, and to understaning how evolutionary forces act on plant populations, and how plant genomes respond to the environment.
  - plant develippment, physiology, and biochemistry
  - polygenic local adaptation: the subtle shifts in allele frequency of many loci.

Modern genomic methods have made considering gene expression a quantifiable phenotypic trait, though the link between gene expression 
and traits in plants has yet to be fully elucidated.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are used to establish association between a trait and a genomic marker, often a signle
nucleotide polymorphism, and are used in almost all fields of biological research. In humans, they have been used successfully to 
identify genomic markers associated with disease risk and other traits [Sanjak]. In plants, GWAS have found association between 
important traits and their geentic markers. For example....

However, quantitative traits remain difficult to link to the full spectrum of impactful genes. 

My interests are in the quantitative traits in crops, and measuring how traits 

harnessing the large amounts of genomic data available to elucidate otherwise unknown genomic architecture behind traits

many small effects, many polygenic traits that the plant scientific community has not been able to clarify
  - examples....

GxG interactions, cis and trans effects

Maize genetic history
  - domestication
  - genome duplication? [not sure this is important information for me]
  - local adaptation

====================

Goals and Objectives

The goal of the project is to elucidate the genetic architecture of quantitative traits in populations of maize. 

Local adaptation - selection causes traits in one population to diverge from a trait value shared among populations. In plants, many
of the traits acted up by selection are quantitative traits.

the field is beginning to 
characterize the complexity of genetic networks

Gene expression clusters have been used to help find relationships betweem polygenic traits and the



To study the maize transcriptome dynamics and use transcriptome data to draw conclusions about selection of quantitative traits, 

and to predict dyanmics in field conditions.


- Find QTL assocaited with traits
- Find eQTL - SNPs associated with the expression of genes
- reduce dimension of data by clustering genes by expression patterns using WGCNA
- find QTL associated with gene modules
  - go into detail on the genes within a module
- calculated the covariance of QTL alllele frequency and direction QTL effects to detect local, polygenic adaptation

OR just Figure of GWAS of module and GWAS of genes win module.

This project will show the genomic architecture of quantitative traits important to agriculture, and will also address
how selection has shaped teh variation within the maize lines studied.

[but... this]

Current Project Outline

I've begun to answer these questions using publically available data. 

Used publically available data. Wisconsin diversity panel that measured a number of traits in 705 inbred maize lines [cite],
as well as RNA-Seq expression data from [number of overlap] of those lines [cite]. 

We also used publically available genotype data from Panzea [cite] with genome by sequencing data for more than 17,000 maize lines,
of which [number] of the maize lines I had expression data for were represented.

Part 1: Genetic Architecture underlying traits
Part 2: Transcriptome architecture 
  - reduction of dimensions for data
Part 3: Signatures of selection on quantitative traits
  - Qx [berg and coop]
Part 4: 


====================
Next Steps and Future Plans

If successful, this project will be expanded on to use the data from landraces in maize that are adapted to specific environments, to 
elucidate the genetic architecutre and the selection on the genetic architecture that underlys the local adaptation.
