Introduction

Relevance and Justificiation

Problem:
	Plant quantitative traits are important to both plants and humans
	The genomic architecture underlying quantitative tratis is difficult to study

Relevance
	Studying and characterizing quantitatvive traits will be valuable to both breeders
	of crops, and to scientists studying natural plant populations.
	Breeders - many traits breeders value in crops are quantitative, and clearly understanding the 
	genetic architecture may (has?) enhanced the effectivness and effeciency of breeding programs.
	Plant Research - it's unclear how the genetic architecture underlying quantitative traits responds to 
	selection in plant populations [Josephs et al], clarifying this will be good.

Concepts to introduce

	Quantitative trait
	Selection
	Population - in maize specifically
	QWAS
	Qx
	effect size and direction

Goals and Objectives

1. Characterize the genetic architecture underlying traits from Hirsch et al.
	- GWAS
2. Characterize the genetic architecture underlying gene co-expression modules
	- unpack the modules and compare eigen GWAS with eQTL for genes in module
3. Calculate signatures of selection on the quantitative traits
4. Design maize common garden experiments for Mexico landraces (or data from landraces) that show adaptation to environmental stresses (Highland maize project)
OR
4. Questions about how gene expression can be used as a phenotype for genetic studies [a la Nango et al.]

Project Outline

Data used: 
	Hirsch et al.
		- X number of maize lines from Y population groups
		- Phenotype data
	Panzea
		- GBS dat, maize genome version 3

Programs and tools used:
	WGCNA
	GEMMA

1. GWAS for traits measured 
	- # of SNPs analyzed
	- results of this:
		- any specific trait that has any nice peak

2. WGCNA Modules
	- about the modules 
		- X number of modules, with the range of Y-Z genes in each module
	- GWAS on the eigen genes of the modules
		- Figure 1 for one of the modules
3. eQTL on expression data of genes
	- X number of genes
	- comparing genes within module to the module eigengene GWAS results (Figure 1)

Project Progress

Figure 1

Diversity Panel lines
	- population strucutre, # of 

Calculated GWAS for 12 traits for which there was phenotypic data.
	- saw X-X range of number of peaks, of which Y% has genes within Zkb

Another graduate student created WGCNA modules
	- 13 modules
	- with X-Y range of genes per module

Next Steps and Future Plans

Measures of selection
	- from the GWAS on traits (or on modules), select the top X SNPs from the GWAS
	- get the direction of the effect
	- calculate Qx

Plans for how this can incorporate with the highland project
	- using data gathered from the maize highland project,
		look for maize selection to stressful environmental conditions

Characterize the usefulness of this approach
	- is it accurate?
	- what is the possible false-positive rate [why does Qx not create false positives again?]

Explore how expression data can be used as a quantitative trait.
