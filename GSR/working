Relevance and Justificiation

Problem:
	Plant quantitative traits are important to both plants and humans
	The genomic architecture underlying quantitative tratis is difficult to study

Relevance
	Studying and characterizing quantitatvive traits will be valuable to both breeders
	of crops, and to scientists studying natural plant populations.
	Breeders - many traits breeders value in crops are quantitative, and clearly understanding the 
	genetic architecture may (has?) enhanced the effectivness and effeciency of breeding programs.
	Plant Research - it's unclear how the genetic architecture underlying quantitative traits responds to 
	selection in plant populations [Josephs et al], clarifying this will be good.

	Genomic data is less expensive to generate, and is being generated in abundance. Developing methods to sift signals from 
	the genomic noise defines the usefulness of the data generated. Agriculture is [citation] begin to utilize data science to 
	target desirable traits, either for genetic engineering, or for targeted breeding [genomic prediction?]. Developing methods
	that advance methods of analysis, and for identifying the co

	[I'm not sure what I want from this paragraph. That more data means more information? That more data *can* mean better understanding.]
	[as is, this paragraph sounds like I'm describing a totally different project.]
	With the amount of data being generated, the amount of complexity plant scientists are able to analyze increases. Plant development,
	biochemistry, and physiology are complicated networks of interactions: gene-gene, gene-environment, phenotype-environment. Molecular
	genetics has been able to characterize many key genetic pathways and their physiological traits, but often scientists are able to capture
	only a snapshot of the genetic dynamics. For example, Nagano et al showed that gene expression dynamics increases in complexity in a
	field environment compared to a well-controlled greenhouse experiment, but also in predictable ways. To generate robust models for the 
	prediction of gene expression, Nagano et al combined transcriptome data from hundreds of samples with meteorological data, with 14 different
	regression models to deescribe .

Goals and Objectives

1. Characterize the genetic architecture underlying traits from Hirsch et al.
	- GWAS
2. Characterize the genetic architecture underlying gene co-expression modules
	- unpack the modules and compare eigen GWAS with eQTL for genes in module
3. Calculate adaption of polygenic traits among populations sampled
4. Some other idea

Project Outline

Data used: 
	Hirsch et al.
		- 705 number of maize lines from 14 population groups
		- Expression data from 507 lines of maize
			- RNA-Seq data
			Filtering: only analyzed genes with expression in each line of maize, and after filtering for expression there was transcriptome 
			data for
		- Phenotype data for 714 maize lines.

	Panzea
		- GBS dat, maize genome version 3
		- 17K lines of maize
		Filtering:
			- removed lines of maize that had more than 40% missing data (could be higher)
			- included only lines of maize we had transcriptome and phenotype data for

	We used maize lines that were included in all three data sources. In addition, we filtered the transcriptome data for genes that expressed
	across all maize lines, and 
	After filtering data, the following analysis was done on
		- 316 lines of maize
		- with transcriptome data for 48136 genes
		- 125,210 SNPs (genome wide)



Programs and tools used:
	WGCNA
		- brief description of process
		- eigengene
	GEMMA
		- regression model information
		- description of process

Project Progress

1. GWAS for traits measured
	12 traits
	With 125K SNPs, looked for QTL associated with 13 traits.

	Results:
		- identified X significant QTL, with the range per trait is X-X per trait
		- Y% of these QTL have at least one gene within 1kb of the peak

2.a. WGCNA Modules
	- about the modules:
		- 13 modules, with the range of Y-Z genes in each module
	- GWAS on the eigengenes of the modules
		- eigengene is the first principle component of the expression data of the genes within the module

2.b. eQTL on expression data of genes
	- 48,136 number of genes [this is not the rigth number, I thought it was 15K]
	- comparing genes within module to the module eigengene GWAS results (Figure 1)
	- cis and trans effects of SNPs on module eigengenes

Figure 1: this figure includes results from Aim 2.
	a module GWAS results (midnight blue module?), with some genes from within the module and their QTL


3. Next step, Qx statistic [Berg and Coop]
	- use the top QTL from a GWAS to look for adaptation among populations for that trait, or on those genes.
	- am I using QTL from WGCNA or from trait GWAS?


#########
Next Steps and Future Plans

Measures of selection
	- from the GWAS on traits (or on modules), select the top X SNPs from the GWAS
	- get the direction of the effect
	- calculate Qx

Plans for how this can incorporate with the highland project
	- using data gathered from the maize highland project,
		look for maize selection to stressful environmental conditions

Characterize the usefulness of this approach
	- is it accurate?
	- what is the possible false-positive rate [why does Qx not create false positives again?]
