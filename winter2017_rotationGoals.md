Goals for the Ross-Ibarra-Runcie Rotation, Winter Quarter 2017

The rotation project is to correlate gene expression modules to traits, and these
modules will be used to create genome prediction models. These models can be extended to
QTL mapping and to population-level questions.

Do we want to take the project more in the direction of the Berg and Coop paper, or is
that kind of a side understanding type of thing?

Project Goals

1. Data collection, summarization, curration 
	- The Hirsch et al expression and phenotype data
2. Create gene expression modules using the BSFG method
	- assess if BSFG is the way to go
	- this would create modules of genes that are associated together
3. Create a genomic prediction model
	- there are multiple directions we can go with this, but the most straight
		forward is to predict traits from gene expression information
	- incorporate trait data to create model
	- this model will show association between modules of genes and trait variation
	- or is the idea to put new phenotype in a generate gene modules? Or predict with gene modules are the most associated.
	- How does this work with different environments?

Writing Goals

1. Apply to Plant Science Student Research Assistantship
2. Apply to any other possible fellowships
3. Begin outlining longer term projects for future grants

Reading and Understanding Goals

1. Read two papers a week on selected topics relevant to this project
2. Develop an understanding of scientific questions in the field of population biology and genomic prediction
3. Develop an understanding of expectations and limitations of genomic prediction
