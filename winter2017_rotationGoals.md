Goals for the Ross-Ibarra-Runcie Rotation, Winter Quarter 2017

The rotation project is to correlate expression modules to traits, and these
modules will be used to create gehome prediction models. These models can be extended to
QTL mapping and to population-level questions.

The question I am seeking to answer is...

Do we want to take the project more in the direction of the Berg and Coop paper, or is
that kind of a side understanding type of thing?

1. Data collection, summarization, curration 
	-
2. Create expression modules
	- Use BSFG method
3. Create a genomic prediction model
	- uh, what is this predicting? predicting gene modules based off new phenotypic data.
	- How does this work with different environments?

Reading and Understanding Goals

1. Read two papers a week on selected topics relevant to this project
2. Develop an understanding of scientific questions in the field
3. Develop an understanding of expectations and limitations of genomic prediction
